Ah! Hello. 
...
What? You got the Tome?
Well I suppose that proves it, you're quite capable.
You've also saved anyone in this town from conversion, as well as yourself.
The man you need to find to save your family uses Portals to go between the realms. 
He takes over their strongest fighters and uses them to strengthen his army, and then moves on to the next world.
I have an old friend who knows how to use those portals. He lives to the east. Tell him I sent you and he will help.
Thanks again and have a good day!
