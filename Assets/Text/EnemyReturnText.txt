Joshua:   What's going on around here??
Mother: Get out of here Son, he is taking your Brother away!
Unknown Enemy: Muahahah, he will be a great addition to my army...
Unknown Enemy: This realm is full of so many random types of people. Still there have been a few strong ones.
Unknown Enemy: My mind control still works well! Come now, join my army..
Joshua:   Stop! Give my brother back!
Unknown Enemy: Or what..? You're barely up to my knee, you aren't worth capturing even as a house slave.
Unknown Enemy: Get going before I hurt you too. Actually, I think I will be killing your mother now as well.
Joshua: No!
Unknown Enemy: Good night now.
